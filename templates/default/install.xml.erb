##### Agent Input #####################################################
# The clean and temporary attributes specify the repositories and other
# preferences Installation Manager uses and whether those settings
# should persist after the uninstall finishes.
#
# Valid values for clean:
#      true = only use the repositories and other preferences that are
#           specified in the response file.
#      false = use the repositories and other preferences that are
#           specified in the response file and Installation Manager.
#
# Valid values for temporary:
#      true = repositories and other preferences specified in the
#           response file do not persist in Installation Manager.
#      false = repositories and other preferences specified in the
#           response file persist in Installation Manager.

##### Repositories ###################################################
# Repositories are locations that Installation Manager queries for
# installable packages. Repositories can be local (on the machine
# with Installation Manager) or remote (on a corporate intranet or
# hosted elsewhere on the internet).
#
# If the machine using this response file has access to the internet,
# then include the IBM WebSphere Live Update Repositories in the list
# of repository locations.
#
# If the machine using this response file cannot access the internet,
# then comment out the IBM WebSphere Live Update Repositories and
# specify the URL or UNC path to custom intranet repositories and
# directory paths to local repositories to use.

    ##### IBM WebSphere Live Update Repositories #####################
    # These repositories contain WebSphere Application Server offerings,
    # and updates for those offerings
    #
    # To use the secure repository (https), you must have an IBM ID,
    # which can be obtained by registering at: http://www.ibm.com/account
    # or your Passport Advantage account.
    #
    # And, you must use a key ring file with your response file.

##### Install Packages ###########################################
#
# Install Command
#
# Use the install command to inform Installation Manager of the
# installation packages to install.
#
# The modify attribute is optional and can be paired with an install
# command to add features or paired with an uninstall command to
# remove commands. If omitted, the default value is set to false.
#    false = indicates not to modify an existing install by adding
#            or removing features.
#    true = indicates to modify an existing install by adding or
#           removing features.
#
# The offering ID attribute is required because it specifies the
# offering to be installed. The offering listed must be present in
# at least one of the repositories listed earlier. The example
# command below contains the offering ID for the Base edition of
# WebSphere Application Server.
#
# The version attribute is optional. If a version number is provided,
# then the offering will be installed at the version level specified
# as long as it is available in the repositories. If the version
# attribute is not provided, then the default behavior is to install
# the latest version available in the repositories. The version number
# can be found in the repository.xml file in the repositories.
# For example, <offering ... version='8.5.0.20110617_2222'>.
#
# The profile attribute is required and typically is unique to the
# offering. If modifying or updating an existing installation, the
# profile attribute must match the profile ID of the targeted installation
# of WebSphere Application Server.
#
# The features attribute is optional. Offerings always have at least
# one feature; a required core feature which is installed regardless
# of whether it is explicitly specified. If other feature names
# are provided, then only those features will be installed.
# Features must be comma delimited without spaces.
#
# The feature values for WebSphere Application Server include:
#  core.feature,ejbdeploy,thinclient,embeddablecontainer,samples,
#  liberty,com.ibm.sdk.6_32bit,com.ibm.sdk.6_64bit
#
# The features ejbdeploy, thinclient, embeddablecontainer, and samples
# are subfeatures of core.feature.
# You must install core.feature (full WebSphere Application Server
# profile), liberty (Liberty profile), or both.
#
# You cannot use the Installation Manager to modify, update, or rollback functions
# to modify this installation later and add or remove core.feature (full WebSphere
# Application Server profile) or liberty (Liberty profile).
#
# You can use these functions to add or remove the ejbdeploy, thinclient,
# embeddablecontainer, or samples subfeatures of core.feature later.
# On 32-bit machines, the 32-bit sdk feature will be installed
# automatically even if it is not specified in the response file.
#
# On 64-bit machines, one and only one of the Software Development
# Kit features (SDK) must be specified.
#
# The installFixes attribute indicates whether fixes available in
# repositories are installed with the product. By default, all
# available fixes will be installed with the offering.
#
# Valid values for installFixes:
#      none = do not install available fixes with the offering.
#      recommended = installs all available recommended fixes with the offering.
#      all = installs all available fixes with the offering.
#
# Interim fixes for offerings also can be installed while they
# are being installed by including the offering ID for the interim
# fix and specifying the profile ID. A commented out example is
# provided in the install command below.
#
# Installation Manager supports installing multiple offerings at once.
# Additional offerings can be included in the install command,
# with each offering requiring its own offering ID, version, profile value,
# and feature values.
#
# Profile Command
#
# A separate profile command must be included for each offering listed
# in the install command. The profile command informs Installation
# Manager about offering specific properties or configuration values.
#
# The installLocation specifies where the offering will be installed.
# If the response file is used to modify or update an existing
# installation, then ensure the installLocation points to the
# location where the offering was installed previously.
#
# The eclipseLocation data key should use the same directory path to
# WebSphere Application Server as the installationLocation attribute.
#
# Include data keys for product specific profile properties.
# For instance, additional translations can be specified by including
# the cic.selector.nl data key and the language codes as values for
# the translations to install.
#
#  Language code values: cs,de,en,es,fr,hu,it,ja,ko,pl,pt_BR,ro,ru,zh,zh_HK,zh_TW

##### Shared Data Location ############################################
# Uncomment the preference for eclipseCache to set the shared data
# location the first time you use Installation Manager to do an
# installation.
#
# Eclipse cache location can be obtained from the installed.xml file found in
# Linux/Unix: /var/ibm/InstallationManager
# Windows: C:/Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/IBM/Installation Manager
# from the following property:
# <property name='cacheLocation' value='C:/Program Files/IBM/IMShared'/>
#
# Open the installed.xml file in a text editor because the style sheet
# might hide this value if opened in a web browser.
# For further information on how to edit preferences, refer to the public library at:
# http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/install/v1r6/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.silentinstall12.doc/topics/r_silent_prefs.html
#
# After the shared data location is set, it cannot be changed
# using a response file or the graphical wizard.
#
# Ensure that the shared data location is a location that can be written
# to by all user accounts that are expected to use Installation Manager.
#
# By default, Installation Manager saves downloaded artifacts to
# the shared data location. This serves two purposes.
#
# First, if the same product is installed a more than once to the machine,
# then the files in the shared data location will be used rather than
# downloading them again.
#
# Second, during the rollback process, the saved artifacts are used.
# Otherwise, if the artifacts are not saved or are removed, then
# Installation Manager must have to access the repositories used to
# install the previous versions.
#
# Valid values for preserveDownloadedArtifacts:
#     true = store downloaded artifacts in the shared data location
#     false = remove downloaded artifacts from the shared data location
#

##### Preferences Settings ############################################
# Additional preferences for Installation Manager can be specified.
# These preference correspond to those that are located in the graphical
# interface under File / Preferences.
#
# If a preference command is omitted from or commented out of the response
# file, then Installation Manager uses the preference value that was
# previously set or the default value for the preference.
#
# Preference settings might be added or deprecated in new versions of
# Installation Manager. Consult the online Installation Manager
# Information Center for the latest set of preferences and
# descriptions about how to use them.
